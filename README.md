## COMPILED FROM:
This list of hosts is compiled from real server logs on my own servers where I run a number of very busy web sites. This list of hosts forms the basis of the bad referrers domain lists for The Nginx Ultimate Bad Bot Blocker at: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker and the Apache Ultimate Bad Bot Blocker at: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker

## WHAT IS A HOSTS FILE?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware, ransomware, porn 
and other nuisance web sites.

## WHERE DO I PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER?
To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android**: `/etc/hosts` folder.

**Windows Systems**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` folder.
